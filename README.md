In this project, I tried to reproduce some of the work done in the paper DNA Sequence Classification by Convolutional Neural Network. Researchers treated DNA data like text and used CNNs to classify various DNA sequences. By reproducing their architecture, I am able to fine tune models that achieve close to their accuracy or better.

I wanted to do this project because to learn more about the rules of CRISPR. I am planning on implementing a network to classify and generate sequences that are good for CRISPR. I would like to better my understanding of making models with sequence data so when data for my project is collected, Iâ€™m ready to hit the ground running.
